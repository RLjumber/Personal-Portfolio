<h1>Hello There!</h1>

<h3>My name is Luke Jumber, fullstack engineer, designer.</h3>

<p>Welcome to my <em>personal</em> portfolio project, for this project I decided to use Next.js 13 as a framework, and to use Vercel to deploy due to the integration between the two platforms.</p>

<p>This repository is connected to Vercel's hosting platform as well, allowing for automatic updates to my website with the latest code whenever I commit to the main branch.</p>
</div>






This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
