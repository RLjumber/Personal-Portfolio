# Hello There!

## My name is Luke Jumber, a fullstack engineer and designer.

#### You can find my website [here](https://personal-portfolio-teal-chi.vercel.app/)


##### Technical Overview
Welcome to my *personal* portfolio project, for this project I decided to use [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) 13 as a framework, and to use Vercel to deploy due to the integration between the two platforms.

This repository is connected to Vercel's hosting platform as well, allowing for automatic updates to my website with the latest code whenever I commit to the main branch. 

##### Content Overview
For my portfolio, I wanted a clean, simple, and logical website, with efficient and elgant code and rendering. Many of my projects tend to be colorful and full, so for this project I really wanted a style that didn't feel like it was there, to then direct attention and motion towards my other works. I wanted this project to be the culmination in behind the scenes work for this year so far while appearing as the crossroads between links, a simple and functional hub. 

Type has been a large part of my work as a [designer](https://tallwood.online/) and this design style allows them to truly stand out. I see text and images as the building blocks of everything, which seems obvious so I decided to lean into that, creating a website which give you your information as plainly as possible, which highlighting all the necessities and minimizing extra bits of design and content.





This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
